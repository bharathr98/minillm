This repository contains annotated implementation of [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). It is currently an incomplete Jupyter notebook. The intention is to finish the full implementation and then expand the notebook out into a workbook-style guide to understanding what the architecture does.
